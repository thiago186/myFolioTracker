## What's up with myFolioTracker? 🤔

Ahoy there! Welcome to **myFolioTracker**. As I embark on this coding voyage, sailing the vast oceans of JavaScript and Python integration, I invite you to hop on board. ⛵

So, what's the mission? We're aiming to create a dandy platform where users can log their buys, sells, and take a gander at their portfolio's performance. And while today it's just a humble raft of learning, tomorrow it could be the grand ship of financial tracking. 🚢

With **myFolioTracker**, we're not just settling for the usual. We’re handing you the wheel, with custom features that many other trackers have overlooked – like tweaking an asset's price for any day or clustering assets for a snazzy group analysis. Because, why not?

## Project Architecture ⛏️

- **Frontend**: Slick and dynamic, all thanks to JavaScript and the React framework.
- **Backend**: We've got Python covering our back, armed with the Django framework.
- **Database**: Plotting our course with a PostGreSQL compass. 🗺️

## ⚠️ Ahoy Matey! 

This here ship is still in the shipyard! Things are bound to shuffle, shift, and occasionally drop overboard. But don’t fret! All hands are welcome on deck. Got a suggestion or fancy a new feature? Hoist it up!
